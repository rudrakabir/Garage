## ðŸ”§ Adding a New Tool - Quick Guide

To add a new audio tool to the project:

1. Create a new component folder in `src/components/YourTool/`
2. In `App.jsx`, add your tool to the `apps` array:
```javascript
{
  title: "Your Tool Name",
  description: "Brief description of what it does",
  icon: Music4,  // Choose an icon from lucide-react
  link: "/your-tool-route"
}
```
3. Add the route in `App.jsx`:
```javascript
<Route path="/your-tool-route" element={
  <AppLayout>
    <YourTool />
  </AppLayout>
} />
```

That's it! Your tool will automatically appear on the home page with navigation.
